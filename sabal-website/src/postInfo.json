We used the YouTube 8M API for the data (utilizing over 100,000 data points at a time). We implemented real-time animation, using Framer-Motion. When a user searches for a YouTube video title, the website will animate the search process for better visualization. The title optimization algorithm was based ono an analysis of YouTube video titles based on metrics like comments, views, and likes to help content creators optimize their titles for better engagement."
